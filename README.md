Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer- having a virtual machine(VM) is the perfect tool for that.
Virtual Machines in the context of development area means to isolate and maintain a stable environment that will basically run the same way on any host.

_We will be using Vagrant:_
Vagrant is a tool that sits on top of a VM provider. We choose to use vagrant because it is free, reliable and well maintained.
